# Multi-Agent System Environment Mapping

Motionless cameras are positioned in an environment and directed upward. The goal is to construct a mapping of the environement they are in
by finding features on the images they took. The features are looked for by using Harris and SIFT algorithms on the images.
A multi-agent system with reactive agents is used in order to have a plan emerge from the interactions of the agents.
